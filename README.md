- Implemented a typical internal site for restaurants using NodeJs and PSQL for database management. Created different user roles and implemented different use cases specific to each role.
- Maintained in detail information like quantities of ingredients and feedback of customers. Usedsequences and triggers to automate the processes and used indices to speedup the querying
